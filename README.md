# Bank_loan_eligibility_using-ML

The Bank Loan Analysis Project assesses loan eligibility for street vendors by analyzing their weekly transaction data. The process begins with data preprocessing, where techniques like data cleaning and outlier removal ensure the accuracy and reliability of the dataset. The project utilizes a Random Forest Classification model to categorize vendors based on their eligibility, achieving high accuracy and improving the loan approval process. Additionally, a feature importance analysis helps in optimizing loan allocation strategies and risk assessment.

To achieve these objectives, the project employs a robust technology stack, including Python for data handling and model development, Pandas & NumPy for data structuring and manipulation, Scikit-learn for implementing machine learning models, and Matplotlib for data visualization. The insights derived from the data help identify top eligible and non-eligible vendors, understand the distribution of loan approvals and rejections, and analyze the impact of weekly earnings variability on loan eligibility.

The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, F1-score, recall, and precision, ensuring reliable classification of applicants. Feature importance analysis further refines loan disbursement strategies by highlighting the most influential factors in determining eligibility. Moving forward, the project aims to integrate machine learning-based risk assessment for smarter loan allocation and develop predictive models to estimate optimal loan repayment periods, ensuring a more effective and inclusive financial support system.
